							<h2>Our Mission</h2>
							<br>
							<p>We are living in an era marked by swift technological advancements, where technology plays an integral role in our daily lives. Despite this, a notable trend among teenagers is their perception of mathematics and science as dull, challenging, and unengaging. In a random high school homeroom, it's common to find that at least half of the students regard math or science as their least favorite subjects. Our goal is to make STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects more appealing and enjoyable.</p><br>
							<p>We employ a strategy involves breaking down mathematics and science into manageable, bite-sized learning modules, each enhanced with captivating and aesthetically pleasing graphics. Furthermore, these modules will be infused with pop culture designed to resonate with and excite the younger generation. Through this innovative approach, we are committed to sparking a renewed interest in STEM subjects, encouraging students to engage with and appreciate the value of mathematics and science in a fun and interactive manner.</p> <br>
